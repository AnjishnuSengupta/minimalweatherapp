# Migration from Open-Meteo to WeatherAPI

## Overview
This document outlines the complete migration from Open-Meteo API to WeatherAPI for the Minimal Weather App.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0` - For managing environment variables securely

### 2. Project Structure Changes
- Added `.env` file for API key storage
- Added `.env.example` as a template
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` file
- Updated `pubspec.yaml` to include `.env` in assets

### 3. Code Changes

#### Weather Model (`lib/models/weather_model.dart`)
**Removed:**
- Open-Meteo specific JSON parsing
- WMO weather code mapping function
- Manual city name parameter

**Added:**
- WeatherAPI JSON response parsing
- Additional properties: `feelsLike`, `uvIndex`, `cloudCover`, `pressure`, `iconUrl`
- Direct weather condition text from API
- Weather icon URL support

#### Weather Service (`lib/services/weather_service.dart`)
**Removed:**
- Open-Meteo API endpoints (`https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast`)
- Complex city mapping logic for Indian cities
- No-API-key approach

**Added:**
- WeatherAPI endpoints (`http://api.weatherapi.com/v1`)
- API key authentication via environment variables
- Simplified location detection
- Support for both city name and coordinate-based queries
- Better error handling with API-specific error messages

#### Main Application (`lib/main.dart`)
**Added:**
- Environment file loading on app startup
- Flutter dotenv initialization

### 4. API Comparison

| Feature | Open-Meteo | WeatherAPI |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **API Key** | Not required | Required (free tier available) |
| **Data Quality** | Good | Excellent |
| **Weather Icons** | Not provided | Provided |
| **Additional Data** | Limited | UV Index, Feels Like, Cloud Cover, etc. |
| **Global Coverage** | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Rate Limits** | Very generous | 1M calls/month (free tier) |

### 5. Benefits of WeatherAPI

1. **Rich Data**: More comprehensive weather information
2. **Weather Icons**: Direct icon URLs for better UI
3. **Better Location Support**: Improved city recognition
4. **Professional Service**: Dedicated weather data provider
5. **Detailed Conditions**: More specific weather condition descriptions

### 6. Setup Instructions

1. Sign up at [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx)
2. Get your free API key
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
4. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key
5. Run `flutter pub get`
6. Run the app with `flutter run`

### 7. Environment Variables

The app now uses environment variables for secure API key management:

```env
# .env file
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 8. Error Handling

Improved error handling includes:
- API key validation
- Specific error messages from WeatherAPI
- Fallback mechanisms for location detection
- Better network error handling

### 9. Security Improvements

- API keys are stored in environment files
- `.env` file is excluded from version control
- Sensitive data is not hardcoded in source code

## Migration Complete âœ…

The app has been successfully migrated from Open-Meteo to WeatherAPI with enhanced features, better data quality, and improved security practices.
